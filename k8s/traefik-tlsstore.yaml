# Traefik TLSStore: sets the default TLS certificate for all HTTPS routes.
# The secret 'homelab-wildcard-tls' must exist in kube-system.
# It is copied there by bootstrap-certmanager.sh (not managed by ArgoCD).
#
# 'default' is a reserved name in Traefik - it applies to all IngressRoutes
# that don't explicitly specify a certificate.
